# Tower-Defense-Engineered
-----Gameplay Ideas------
- Towers have an RNG added to their accuracy that can be inproved through upgrades
- Player has to recharge/reload towers (less often on upgrade)
- A tower type that shoots an Area of Effect that either does damage or a slow effect 
- Player interact with Tower done through a mouse click when in proximity (opens some sort of menu with options)


-----Level Design Ideas------
- Enemies run in lanes with a layer system set up so the player/towers are on an upper layer connected by bridges that enemies run under towards the base
- Open map that player can add/purchase Barricades to force enemies into bottle necks or let them walk right past in open field 
    - This bring up the Opens up the convo of do we want the player to be able to interact i.e. kill enemies and/or die by getting hit by them

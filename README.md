# Tower-Defense-Engineered
-----Gameplay Ideas------
- Towers have an RNG added to their accuracy that can be inproved through upgrades
- Player has to recharge/reload towers (less often on upgrade)
    - Could include specific upgrade that heavily boosts ammo capacity
    - Should some types of enemies also target towers over rushing base? Or is repair + reload mechanic too much?
- A tower type that shoots an Area of Effect that either does damage or a slow effect 
    - Slow effect would be good and very easy to code
- Player interact with Tower done through a mouse click when in proximity (opens some sort of menu with options)
    - I think the menu is a good idea. Was considering giving an option to select targeting priority of enemies
- Enemy that has the ability to stun towers temporarily
- Player can shoot at enemies using the mouse (we can remove this but the code is there which will be helpful for mouse interactions)


-----Level Design Ideas------
- Enemies run in lanes with a layer system set up so the player/towers are on an upper layer connected by bridges that enemies run under towards the base
    - Do we want to have some way for the player to directly interact with enemies? Maybe dropping bombs or other effects from above
- Open map that player can add/purchase Barricades to force enemies into bottle necks or let them walk right past in open field 
    - This bring up the Opens up the convo of do we want the player to be able to interact i.e. kill enemies and/or die by getting hit by them
    - Doing an open field with barricades would make 

----Stretch Goals----
- Enemies that attack tower/Different types of enemy 
- Randomly spawning enemy locations

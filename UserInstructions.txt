How To Play:
When you spawn in, your objective is to protect the wall from the group of enemies
coming at it. You have two weapons, your character's gun and the towers. The main
idea is to run around repairing the towers while also shooting at enemies with
your own weapon. You will need to repeatedly repair towers so they continue shooting
and upgrade them when possible. There are two levels, and you win after completing the
second level or lose when the wall runs out of health.
